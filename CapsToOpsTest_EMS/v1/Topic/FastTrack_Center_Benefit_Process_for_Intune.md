# FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Intune
If your organization is eligible for the Microsoft Intune service benefit, you can work remotely with Microsoft specialists to get your Microsoft Intune environment ready for use.

Microsoft Intune is the part of Microsoft’s Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), which provides the Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) capabilities, including Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM).  You can use Microsoft Intune to enable your employees to be productive on mobile devices by provisioning devices, configuring devices, and deploying mobile apps.  You can additionally use Microsoft Intune to help protect your corporate data by monitoring device compliance, protecting mobile applications and data, and integrating with Azure AD to control access to corporate services.

To learn whether your organization is eligible, see [FastTrack Center Benefit for Intune](../Topic/FastTrack_Center_Benefit_for_Intune.md). If you are interested in getting your environment ready for other Enterprise Mobility Suite services, see [FastTrack Center Benefit for Enterprise Mobility Suite](../Topic/FastTrack_Center_Benefit_for_Enterprise_Mobility_Suite.md).

- [Your responsibilities](#your_responsibilities) for each phase

Here’s what you can expect when onboarding is complete:

- Your Microsoft Online Service tenant is created.

- Licensed users can access the Microsoft Intune service by using one of the following identity options:

   - Cloud Identities (unique Microsoft online service accounts).

   - Synchronized Identities: Microsoft Intune accounts synchronized from your on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory Connect (Synchronization services):

      - For customers with a single Active Directory forest environment.

      - For customers with supported multi-forests Active Directory topology.

- Federated Identities--Microsoft Intune accounts:

   - Synchronized from Active Directory with the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect tool for customers with a single Active Directory forest configuration or for customers with a single Active Directory account forest (also known as a “logon forest”) and a single Active Directory resource forest configuration.

   - Federated with Windows Server 2012 R2 Active Directory Federation Services role from your on-premises Active Directory or federated with an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0 or later from your on-premises Active Directory.

## <a name="overview_onboarding_process"></a>Overview of the onboarding process
Onboarding has two major components:

- **Core capabilities** - tasks required for tenant configuration and integration with Azure AD, if needed. The core capabilities component also provides the baseline for onboarding other eligible services.

- **Service onboarding** - tasks required to configure Microsoft Intune.

The following diagram describes the sequence of events for using the FastTrack Center Benefit.

The basic process is as follows:

- The FastTrack Center will attempt to contact you within 30 days from the date you purchase an eligible plan. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/), go to the dashboard, select your company name, click the Offers tab, and click the Request Assistance button to request assistance for Microsoft Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium, or Azure Rights Management Premium.

- The FastTrack Center will help you with core capabilities, and then will help you onboard once for each eligible service.

All onboarding support will be provided remotely by assigned Microsoft personnel:

- Microsoft will remotely assist you with various onboarding activities by using a combination of tools, documentation, and guidance.

- Onboarding support is provided by the FastTrack Center, and is available during normal business hours for a given region.

- Onboarding support is available in Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), or Spanish.

- The Microsoft team can work directly with you or your representative.

## <a name="expectations_src_environ"></a>Expectations for your source environment
You may already have services in your source environment that you want to move to, or integrate with, your Microsoft Intune service. For some services, the FastTrack Center Benefit for Intune includes helping you set up some level of integration with your source environment. If integration is required, then your source environment must be at a minimum level for that application.

The following table shows what is expected in your existing source environment for onboarding.

|Activity <br /> <br />|Source environment expectation <br /> <br />|
|------------|----------------------------------|
|Core capabilities <br /> <br />|Active Directory forests with the functional forest level set to Windows Server 2008 or above, with the following forest configuration: <br /> <br /><ul><li>Single Active Directory forest </li><li>Multiple Active Directory forests </li> </ul> **Note:** For all multiple forests configurations, AD FS deployment is out of scope for the FastTrack Center Benefit. <br />|
|Service onboarding <br /> <br /><ul><li>Microsoft Intune </li><li>Microsoft Intune integrated with System Center Configuration Manager </li> </ul>|For device management with System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2 or later version connected with Microsoft Intune, IT administrators will need to follow the [Administrator Checklist: Configuring Configuration Manager to Manage Mobile Devices by Using Microsoft Intune](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj943763.aspx). **Note:** The service benefit does not include assistance for setting up or upgrading System Center Configuration Manager to the minimum requirements needed for Microsoft Intune integrated with System Center Configuration Manager. <br />|

## <a name="phases_onboarding_process"></a>Phases of the onboarding process
